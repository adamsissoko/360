**Summary:**
The app allows users to log in, create new accounts, and access a persistent SQLLite database to store and manage inventory items, event details, or daily weight. The app also prompts users for permission to send SMS notifications for low inventory, upcoming events, or reaching a goal weight. The goal of the app is to address the user's need for a convenient way to manage their inventory, events, and personal goals while also providing timely notifications.

**Screens and Features:**
The necessary screens and features include a login screen, account creation screen, database grid screen, item details screen, SMS notification permission screen, and settings screen. The UI designs keep users in mind by providing clear and easy-to-understand navigation, prominently displaying important information, and using intuitive controls. The designs were successful because they were simple, yet effective, and focused on the user's needs.

**Coding Process:**
The coding process involved using Android Studio to create the UI, implement the database, and handle SMS messaging. The techniques and strategies used included following best practices, modularizing the code, and using version control. These techniques could be applied in the future to improve code maintainability and scalability.

**Testing:**
The code was tested using the Android Emulator, which helped ensure that it was functional and met the requirements. This process is important because it helps catch bugs and issues early on, saving time and effort in the long run. It also revealed areas where the app could be improved, such as usability and performance.

**Innovation:**
One challenge was designing a UI that was both simple and effective while also providing all the necessary features. To overcome this challenge, we innovated by using a modular design, with each screen having its own unique layout and features. This approach allowed us to provide a consistent user experience while also allowing for customization and flexibility.

**Demonstrating Knowledge and Skills:**
We were particularly successful in demonstrating our knowledge, skills, and experience in developing a persistent SQLLite database and handling SMS messaging. This required an understanding of Android development best practices, as well as a deep knowledge of the Android SDK and programming languages such as Java or Kotlin.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, this app was designed to address the user's need for a convenient way to manage inventory, events, and personal goals while also providing timely notifications. The UI designs kept users in mind by providing clear and easy-to-understand navigation, prominently displaying important information, and using intuitive controls. The coding process involved using Android Studio to create the UI, implement the database, and handle SMS messaging. Finally, testing helped ensure that the app was functional and met the requirements, and innovation was used to overcome challenges in UI design.
